    Two types of consensus:

        - quantitative: use scenario objective values to score best request–vehicle assignments.

    Attributes:
    ------------
        consensus_type : ConsensusParams(Enum)
            Type of consensus algorithm.
        nb_scenario : int
            Number of scenarios to generate and solve at each step.
        scenario_param : Dict[str, Any]
            Parameters for scenario generation (time_window, cust_node_hour, known_portion, advance_notice).

        vehicle_request_assign : Dict[int, VehicleState]
            Mapping vehicle id to VehicleState (inherited from Solver). Each state holds: vehicle,
            assigned_requests, departure_stop, departure_time, last_stop, last_stop_time, assign_possible,
            random_number; used to save assignments and build route plans.

        network : Any
            The road network, including nodes representing stop points.
        durations : Dict
            Travel time matrix between stop points (e.g. self.durations[from_label][to_label]).
        costs : Dict
            Driving cost matrix (same structure as durations).
        algorithm: Algorithm(Enum)
            The optimization algorithm utilized for planning and assigning trips to vehicles.
        objective: Objectives(Enum)
            The objective used to evaluate the effectiveness of the plan (e.g., maximizing profit or minimizing wait time).
        objective_value: float
            The objective value from served requests.
        total_customers_served: int
            The count of customers successfully served.
