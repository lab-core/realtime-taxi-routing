## multimodalsim Package Overview

The `multimodalsim` package is a Python library for simulating multi-modal discrete event transportation systems, focusing on the dynamics between trips (passengers) and vehicles within a network. It enables the comprehensive setup, execution, and analysis of simulations to evaluate transportation strategies.

### Key Components
- **Agents**: Simulates two primary agents: trips (passengers) and vehicles. Trips are modeled as `Trip` objects with detailed attributes, including origin, destination, and timing constraints. Vehicles modeled as `Vehicle` objects, transport passengers based on the simulation's dynamics.

- **Environment**: The simulation environment where all agents operate, and events are processed.

- **Events**: Fundamental units driving the simulation's progress. Events are categorized into optimization, passenger, and vehicle events. The handling of events follows a priority queue mechanism, ensuring timely and orderly processing.

### Simulation Flow
The simulation process is categorized into three main phases: Data Preparation, Initialization of Simulation Components, and Execution of the Simulation.

### 1. Read and Prepare Data
This phase involves reading input data, visualizing the network, and preparing vehicles and trips for the simulation.

- **Data Reading**:
  Utilize a `TaxiDataReader` to read in taxi requests, vehicle information, and the network graph.
    ```python
    data_reader = TaxiDataReader(requests_file_path, vehicles_file_path, graph_file_path, vehicles_end_time=100000)
    vehicles, routes_by_vehicle_id = data_reader.get_json_vehicles()
    trips = data_reader.get_json_trips(solution_mode, time_window)
    ```

- **Network Visualization**:
  Extract and draw the network graph for a visual representation of the network's structure.
    ```python
    network_graph = data_reader.get_json_graph()
    draw_network(network_graph, graph_file_path)
    ```
    
### 2. Initialize Simulation Components
Set up the core components of the simulation, including the dispatcher, optimization model, and environment observer. Insidee Dispatcher class there are three main methods for prearing inputs, optimizing and creating route plans.

- **Dispatcher Setup**:
  Initialize a `TaxiDispatcher` with the network graph, chosen algorithm, and objective.
    ```python
    dispatcher = TaxiDispatcher(network_graph, algorithm, objective)
    ```

- **Optimization Setup**:
  Create an `Optimization` object with the dispatcher to manage trip splitting and route assignment.
    ```python
    opt = Optimization(dispatcher)
    ```

- **Environment Observer**:
  Initialize a `StandardEnvironmentObserver` for simulation monitoring and visualization.
    ```python
    environment_observer = StandardEnvironmentObserver()
    ```

### 3. Initialize and Run the Simulation
Set up the simulation with all components and execute it.

- **Simulation Initialization**:
  Create a `Simulation` object with the optimization model, trips, vehicles, routes, network graph, and environment observer. 
    ```python
    simulation = Simulation(opt, trips, vehicles, routes_by_vehicle_id, network=network_graph, environment_observer=environment_observer)
    ```

- **Simulation Execution**:
  Start the simulation process by calling the `simulate` method, managing the state and utilizing the environment observer.
    ```python
    simulation.simulate()
    ```
